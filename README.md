## Boostrap Cookbook - A WBS task

#### Level 1 – Basic HTML & CSS structures

A basic list of recipes
Each list of recipes must have:
Title: Must visually stand out
Description – Not as important as title, still needs enhancements
Image
Table with ingredients

#### Level 2 – Styling Framework / Library

Enhance the style with a library and/or framework

#### Level 3 – CSS Hover animations

When the user hovers the recipe image with the mouse, the recipe title must be displayed on top of it

#### Level 4 – Vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation (just a pinch!)

Add a “Share” button underneath the recipe
When the user clicks on it, an alert with window (JavaScript alert) pops up with the URL of the page
